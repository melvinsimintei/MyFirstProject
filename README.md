# MyFirstProject

Welcome to **MyFirstProject** — my first repository as I learn Git and GitHub!

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a personal playground where I'm practicing:

- Creating and cloning Git repositories
- Committing changes
- Handling merge and rebase conflicts
- Using `.gitignore` to exclude files/folders
- Working with branches and stash

## 🗂️ Files and What They Do

Here’s a brief overview of some of the files I’ve worked on:

- `.gitignore` – Ignores folders like `AppData/`, `.vscode/`, `.log` files, and `.todo`
- `.todo` – Contains a list of tasks to track progress
- `base-file.txt` – Used during rebase conflict experiments
- `merge-conflict.txt` – File used to learn and resolve merge conflicts
- `rebase-conflict.txt` – File created to explore rebase conflicts
- `mystash.txt` – Practiced using `git stash`
- `fixed.txt`, `test.txt`, `ronaldo.txt`, `messi.txt` – Sample files used in various commits

## 📚 What I'm Learning

- Basic Git commands (`init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`)
- How to resolve merge and rebase conflicts
- How to structure a simple Git project
- GitHub workflow using commits and branches

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- Git (using Git Bash on Windows)
- GitHub (for remote repository management)
- VS Code (as my main code editor)

## ✅ Next Steps

- Learn how to collaborate on a team project
- Explore pull requests and code reviews
- Add more structured features or scripts
